Landing page

I created a modern business landing page, focusing on both visual appeal and interactivity. The layout included a structured header, a compelling hero section, and a series of feature cards designed with engaging animations. I implemented a dark theme with vibrant orange accents and included a toggle for light mode, allowing users to switch themes seamlessly. The page featured interactive elements like 3D parallax effects on cards, hover transitions, and ripple effects on clicks to enhance the user experience. Responsiveness was a key priority, so I used CSS Grid and media queries to ensure the design adapted well across devices. The entire project was built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries.

 One of the main challenges I faced was balancing multiple animations and interactions while maintaining smooth performance across various screen sizes and devices, but through careful optimization and testing, I achieved a stable and engaging user interface.
